I spent two hours completing this assessment and really enjoyed it. I liked interacting with Figma and the specific dimensions. The most challenging part was the pagination. As you can see in my code, I tried to create a functional pagination but then opted for the SVG provided in Figma. If I were to redo the assessment, I would clarify the specifics of images, functionality, etc. For example, the figma didn't portray the user being able to press 'esc' or click outside of the modal to exit. I chose to incorporate this into my version. I also would have liked to dive into the 'next' button and what the next page would include.
